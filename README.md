# PancakeSwap Profile SDK Demo

This repo contains source code of PancakeSwap Profile SDK Demo site - include link here once available

It is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes [@pancakeswap/profile-sdk](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-toolkit/tree/master/packages/pancake-profile-sdk) to retrieve PancakeSwap profile data.

Profile retrieval is done inside [AppContext.tsx](src/AppContext.tsx) that handles the app state (i.e. stores achievements, loading statuses, etc.)
